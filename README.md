# ANN-Churn-Modeling
This repository is to analyse a bank-customers data and the goal is to reduce the churn of customers using ANN.

The dataset is taken from this [link](https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/). The dataset comes with several variables such as: 
	1. Geography (i.e. names of country)
	2. Names of customers
	3. Their credit score
	4. Bank balance,
	and few others along with target variable 'Exited' (0/1) where 0 means that an individual didn't leave the bank.


I'll try to answer the question: What are some key reasons (or key features) that play major role in customers' churn?
